### FIRST LECTURE

Tight coupling of UI and data - MVC solved

-> new and switch and if-else-if ladder should be avoided

-> Abstract classes defer methods(I will do this, my children will do others), interfaces make the contract to implement methods

### SECOND LECTURE

-> is-a relationship - class, behaviour- create an interface
-> POLYMORPHISM - ability to call a method WITHOUT knowing the exact type

-> Factory outsource the creation of object

### THIRD LECTURE

-> Base class becomes the factory having factory method(create computer)
